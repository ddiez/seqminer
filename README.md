seqminer
========

Summary
-------

`seqminer` is a framework for the identification of sequences from protein families. It was developed to generate the dataset used to populate the [varDB](http://vardb.org) database of antigenic variant families.

Release history
---------------

This repository serves as an archive (tag `release_1`) of the code used for varDB up to release 14.1 (Jan 16, 2013). I have no intention to further develop it. Also, the current code is rather chaotic since it was developed before I learned enough to care about those issues.

Usage
-----

I haven't tested it recently, but the main scripts were `sm_install.rb` and `sm_pipeline.rb`. Also, all files starting with `test_<something>.rb` were used to test specific functionality as it was added. Kind of unit testing except that it was not automatically executed, unfortunately.
